# Trackboss Tracker

(or is my trackboss having a heart attack)

## What? Why? How?

Started out as a discussion based on my experience as a DeepRacer track boss especially helping support the 2019 Championship at re:Invent.  Having just chased another fast car around the track and taking a breather in between competitors I thought it might be interesting to be able to show the heart rate (and step data) of the track boss in real time as part of the DeepRacer event experience (and be handy to see if the Trackboss was having a heart attack).
